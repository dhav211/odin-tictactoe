# Tic-Tac-Toe

Honestly this proved to be much more work than expected, but was a good ole fashioned fun time. Started building the game with tests in mind but as I started implementing modules I oddly broke the testing. Suppose I need to learn about modules better. Not sure if I really had effective tests but they seemed to make me more confident and I wished I used them all the way through development. Other notes, I added resposiveness via javascript. The width of the grid is handled by CSS's clamp function, but javascript will get the width of the grid and set it as the height, so it's nice and square on all devices. I know the AI algorithm is minimax but my arrogance decided to make my own AI behavior which turned out quite well.

Over all, good times, and here's too finishing the Odin Project someday!
